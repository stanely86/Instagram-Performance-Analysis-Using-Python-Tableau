This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using Instagram performance data exported from Meta Business Suite. The goal was to uncover insights into post engagement and audience behavior by transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations.

Using Python, I cleaned and converted the original text-based metrics into numerical values suitable for analysis. I then built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize trends such as engagement rates, post reach, and top-performing content.
